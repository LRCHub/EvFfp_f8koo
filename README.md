[00:11.64] I was trying to find a way to kill time
[00:17.24] I didn't even get to tell you goodbye
[00:22.84] I was trying to find a way to kill time
[00:28.34] Now you're gone, and I can't ever say goodbye
[00:50.84] 
[00:34.68] This feeling's going to my head
[00:37.54] I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
[00:40.21] You circled me inside my room
[00:43.07] I couldn't go another day
[00:45.82] This feeling's going to my head
[00:48.62] I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
[00:51.54] You circled me inside my room
[00:54.36] I couldn't go, go, go, go
[01:06.86] 
[00:57.37] Oh my God, what the fuck
[00:58.29] Take my hand, crush it up
[00:59.78] Spill the blood on the floor
[01:01.02] I ain't scared, think there's more
[01:02.52] What the fuck, make it stop
[01:03.98] Took too long, here right now
[01:18.48] 
[01:05.48] On the floor, in the yard
[01:06.70] Smoking cigs in the bar
[01:08.20] I don't want you to think
[01:09.76] I got bad intentions
[01:11.03] Never wanted you inside
[01:12.46] You made it your mission, yeah (yeah)
[01:13.72] Didn't wanna hurt no one (no one)
[01:16.95] But you just went and made it fun, fun, fun, fun
[01:40.95] 
[01:19.46] Hear you're lookin' for a way to fight the Corpus bride
[01:22.08] She's workin' in my mind
[01:24.17] And you're lookin' for a way to crush, it's not enough
[01:27.46] You fucked up your last try, last try
[01:45.96] 
[01:30.57] We were in the studio
[01:31.76] I was just playin'
[01:33.12] You were all work and
[01:34.41] I was all play and
[01:35.95] You were talkin' business
[01:37.24] Aiming with your weapon
[01:38.68] I was on your hit list
[01:40.15] I felt the compression
[01:51.15] 
[01:43.09] I'll never go
[01:43.62] I'll haunt your studio
[01:44.98] You won't think of words
[01:46.23] When you write it up
[01:47.78] You'll just hear
[01:49.35] Me singing this song
[01:50.63] You'll think that's okay
[01:51.97] You'll just sing along
[02:02.97] 
[01:53.67] You just copy everything we do
[01:56.55] If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too
[01:59.36] You just copy everything we do
[02:01.56] If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too
